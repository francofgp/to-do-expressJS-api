# ExpressJS to-do API
### **What is this API about?**

<br>
This is an API where you can do the following:
<br>

-   Log in.
-   Sign up.
-   Create task
-   Read Task
-   Update Task
-   Delete Task
-   Upload an image
-   And more...

It also comes with JWT authentication, and it uses SendGrid to send email when you signup or delete your account.

Some of the endpoint are tested with the **Jest** library.

## [Execute in your editor](#Execute-in-your-editor)

---
Before run the API, you should have installed MongoDB in your computer, and configured the following files:

- *dev.env*
- *test.env*

Feel free to modify these files with you config or use the default.


```bash
PORT=3000
SENDGRID_API_KEY=MySecretApiKey
MONGODB_URL=mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/todo
JWT_SECRET=secretkey
```

``Attention``: You should use your own **SENDGRID_API_KEY**, by default all the functions that use the SendGrid API are commented, that way you will not have any error if you don't have the private key ðŸ˜‰.

### [Run the project](#Run-the-project)
---

Use [NPM](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/install.html) to run the project:

npm run start
```

You can also run it using nodemon:

```bash
npm run dev
```



## [Run all the tests](#Run-all-the-tests)
